 * `markOffline` on a failed request raises the flag, the next successful
 * reply clears it, and `Layout` shows the banner in between.
 *
 * The header check and clock reasoning in `noteResponse` survive for the
 * cases where a cached reply can still reach the app: the first load after
 * upgrading from a build that did cache (its worker answers that one load and
 * may stamp `FROM_CACHE_HEADER`), and any intermediary that ignores
 * `Cache-Control: no-store`. Belt and braces — in the priority order here,
 * calling stale data stale is worth a false alarm.
