/**
 * Entries logged while the server was unreachable, waiting to be sent.
 *
 * This is the one piece of local storage the "never cache API data" rule does
 * not cover, and the distinction matters. The service worker keeps no copy of
 * server data because a saved copy of *the server's* answer reads as a fact
 * about the baby and can be false — she may have been fed twice since. An
 * entry sitting in here is the opposite thing: it is the user's own write, on
 * the device that made it, which the server has not seen yet. Nothing about it
 * can be contradicted by a server the app cannot reach, and dropping it on the
 * floor because the radio was down is straightforwardly losing data the user
 * entered.
 *
 * So: reads stay honest by keeping nothing, writes stay honest by keeping
 * everything, and the UI is required to label anything in here as not yet
 * synced (see `pendingRowsFor` and `PendingSyncBanner`) so it is never counted
 * as something the other caregiver's phone can see.
 *
 * Safety rests entirely on the idempotency key already built for retries (see
 * `server/src/routes/idempotency.ts`). Every queued create carries the
 * `client_request_id` it was given when the user pressed Save, so a flush can
 * be attempted any number of times, from any number of tabs, against a server
 * that may already have applied it — the second attempt is answered with the
 * row the first one created. That is what makes "retry until it lands" a safe
 * policy rather than a way to log the same feed five times.
 *
 * ## Why localStorage and not IndexedDB
 *
 * A queue is a natural fit for IndexedDB, and IndexedDB is the only storage a
 * service worker can reach — which is what a Background Sync implementation
 * would need. Background Sync is not available on iOS Safari, which is most of
 * this app's installs, so the queue has to drain from the foreground anyway;
 * paying for a store the foreground doesn't need buys nothing. localStorage is
 * synchronous (so an enqueue cannot lose a race with the page being torn
 * down), shared across tabs with a change event, and matches `formDraft.ts`.
 * The volume is a handful of small objects during an outage, nowhere near the
 * quota. If Background Sync ever becomes worth having, moving to IndexedDB is
 * a change behind this module's exports.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not queued
 *
 * Only creates. An edit or a delete offline is an operation *on a row the
 * server owns*, and the row may have been changed or removed by the other
 * caregiver in the meantime — replaying it later would silently overwrite work
 * this device never saw. Creates have no such hazard: an entry that did not
 * exist cannot have been concurrently modified, and every entity here sorts by
 * a client-supplied timestamp, so one logged at 14:05 and flushed at 16:30
 * lands in the log at 14:05 where it belongs. Timers are also excluded — a
 * running timer is server-side state whose whole meaning is "started now", and
 * starting one offline to flush it hours later would be a lie.
