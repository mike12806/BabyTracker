 * The live-update socket — how this device finds out that the other caregiver

 *
 * What arrives here is a nudge, never data: `{ type: "change" }` and nothing
 * else. The app still fetches every entry over `/api/*` exactly as it did when
 * a timer drove the refetch. That is deliberate and load-bearing — the rule in
 * AGENTS.md is that API data is never cached anywhere, and rows pushed down a
 * socket would be precisely that: a second copy of the data, arriving by a
 * path with no `Cache-Control` and no staleness accounting. A nudge cannot go
 * stale, so there is nothing here to get wrong.
 *
 * This replaces one refresh trigger, not the refresh machinery. Coming back to
 * the app, reconnecting, an `online` event and the outbox flush all still do
 * what they did; see `useDataRefresh.tsx`. What the socket removes is the
 * minute of latency between one phone logging a feed and the other showing it.
 *
 * A module singleton rather than React state, like `freshness.ts` and
 * `outbox.ts` next door: exactly one socket per tab regardless of what mounts,
 * and the provider that consumes it sits *above* the one that knows which
 * child is selected, so a context would not have reached it anyway.
