/**
 * The alerts bell, and the drawer behind it.
 *
 * This is the app's own copy of the notifications it sends — see
 * `server/src/alerts.ts` for why the push alone was not enough. Two things
 * follow from that and are worth not undoing:
 *
 *  - **It is a record, not a second decision.** Nothing here works out whether
 *    a feed is overdue; it renders the sentence the server sent, as sent. A
 *    trend alert's figures describe the moment it was raised, so recomputing
 *    them against the current clock would put words in its mouth.
 *  - **It is never cached**, like every other read in this app. A closed
 *    drawer holds whatever the last fetch returned, and the feed refetches
 *    with everything else on `refreshKey`.
 *  - **Dismissing hides, for this user only.** The alert row is shared with
 *    everyone linked to the child, so tidying your own bell must not take an
 *    unread alert off theirs. It is offered with an undo because this app gets
 *    used one-handed, mid-feed, where a mis-tap on a small row is routine.
