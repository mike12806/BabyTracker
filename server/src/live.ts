/**
 * Live change notifications over WebSocket.
 *
 * The app used to find out that the other caregiver had logged something by
 * refetching everything once a minute (`FOREGROUND_POLL_MS` in the client).
 * That is up to a minute of showing a dashboard that is quietly wrong about
 * when the baby was last fed, and 1,439 refetches a day that return exactly
 * what the app already had. This replaces the *trigger*, not the fetching: a
 * change here pushes a one-line nudge, the client bumps `refreshKey`, and the
 * data still arrives over the same `/api/*` routes as before.
 *
 * That split is deliberate and worth keeping. `client/AGENTS.md` says API data
 * is never cached anywhere, and a socket that pushed rows would be exactly
 * that — a second copy of the data, arriving by a path with no `Cache-Control`
 * and no staleness accounting. A nudge carries no data, so there is nothing to
 * go stale and nothing to reconcile.
 *
 * A Durable Object is not optional here. A plain Worker can complete a
 * WebSocket handshake, but the isolate that did it can be evicted at any
 * moment and there is no way for a *later* request (the POST that logs a feed)
 * to reach the socket it left open. The DO is the addressable thing that both
 * halves can find: `child:<id>`, derived from the child every write already
 * names.
 *
 * Cost is why every socket is accepted with `ctx.acceptWebSocket()` rather
 * than `ws.accept()`. The hibernation API lets the runtime evict this object
 * while the sockets stay connected, so an idle household is billed nothing;
 * `ws.accept()` would bill wall-clock duration for as long as anyone had the
 * app open, which for the tablet on the changing table is all day. Nothing in
 * this class may hold a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout` or an alarm — any of
 * them pins the object in memory and quietly turns hibernation off.
