/**
 * A tiny read-through cache over the `CACHE` KV namespace.
 *
 * ## Why KV at all, when D1 is right there
 *
 * D1 stays the source of truth for everything — nothing in this file stores
 * anything you cannot rebuild by asking D1 (or Cloudflare Access) again. What
 * KV buys is the *read path*: a KV read is served from the colo the request
 * landed in, while a D1 read crosses the network to wherever the database
 * lives. For a value that is written once a day and read on every page load,
 * that is the difference between paying for the round trip once and paying for
 * it every time.
 *
 * So the rule for what belongs here is not "is it hot" but **"is a slightly
 * stale answer still a correct answer"**. KV is eventually consistent: a write
 * can take up to a minute to be visible everywhere, which is fine for a note
 * written by a 5am cron and disastrous for a feed logged thirty seconds ago by
 * the other parent. Entry data is therefore never cached here — see the list
 * in `server/AGENTS.md` for what is, and why each one qualifies.
 *
 * ## Failure is not an error
 *
 * Every function below swallows its errors and logs. A cache is an
 * optimisation, and an optimisation that can fail the request it was meant to
 * speed up is worse than no cache: without the binding (tests, local dev
 * without `wrangler dev`) or with KV having a bad minute, every call here
 * quietly degrades to "miss" and the caller reads D1 exactly as it did before
 * this file existed. That is also why `Env.CACHE` is optional, like `LIVE` and
 * the queues.

 * miss — and makes a miss *slower* than not caching at all, since the caller

 * the read. That is a real regression on exactly the requests that were
 * already the slow ones, and it is invisible in a hit-rate metric.
 *
 * The write cannot simply be left unawaited instead: a promise the Worker
 * runtime does not know about may be cancelled once the response is sent, so
