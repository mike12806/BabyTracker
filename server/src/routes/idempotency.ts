 * *back* has already been applied, and retrying it logs the feed a second time.
 * That left every write one dropped response away from being lost, and every
 * double-tap one row away from being duplicated.
 *
 * A key supplied by the client closes both. It is recorded in the same
 * transaction as the row it describes, under a unique index, so a replay of the
 * same key cannot insert anything — it finds the original row and returns it.
 * The client then sees the same 201 and the same entry it would have seen if
 * the first response had arrived.
 *
 * Requests without a key behave exactly as they always did. An installed PWA
 * updates on its own schedule, so the old client has to keep working.
